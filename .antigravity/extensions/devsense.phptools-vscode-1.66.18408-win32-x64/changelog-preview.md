## 1.66.18408 (January 29, 2026)

### Minor Features

#### Parameter Validation

Added parameter validation for Closure and indirect function invocations.  
  [#2503](https://community.devsense.com/d/2503)

  ![check closure call](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/refs/heads/master/docs/vscode/imgs/cfg-closure-args.png)

#### Refactoring, References, and Navigation

Improved Refactoring, References, and Navigation across `"string"` values in specific code patterns, such as  
  `new ReflectionMethod(FQN::class, "HERE");`.  
  [#2502](https://community.devsense.com/d/2502)

  ![resolve symbols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/refs/heads/master/docs/vscode/editor/imgs/resolve-string-symbols.png)

#### Laravel Support

Added completion support for Laravel controller action methods.  
  [#2502](https://community.devsense.com/d/2502)

  ![laravel controller method completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/refs/heads/master/docs/vscode/editor/imgs/complete-controller-method.png)

#### Editor Insight & Navigation

Enhanced mouse hover and Navigation to provide more detailed method results, using the same logic as code analysis.  
  This improves visibility for generated stubs, helpers, and overloaded methods, and makes it clearer what the editor actually sees internally.

  ![hover all methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/refs/heads/master/docs/vscode/editor/imgs/hover-all-method-stubs.png)

### Fixes

- Fixes semantic highlight and unused `use` check for `Closure` type name in `@var` annotations.
- Fixes missing Symfony polyfills in IntelliSense and avoids false deprecation warning with polyfills.
- Fixed `@formatter:off` behavior to correctly preserve original whitespace and brace placement.

## v1.66.1837 (Jan 26, 2026)

### Fixes

- Fixes method resolution when the flawed `_laravel_ide` stubs are there. [#990](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/990)
- Improves method resolution for static/non-static method calls.
- Improves Laravel Models IntelliSense - static helpers from Query Builder shown and resolved properly.
- Fixes Str::startswith() type inferring based on mehtod's assertions. [#2498](https://community.devsense.com/d/2498)

## v1.66.18374 (Jan 24, 2026)

### Debug

- Added support for function return values. No more temporary variables needed to inspect function results. Captures and displays return values in the Variables pane after a Step Out, clearly identifying the source function (e.g., `strtoupper()`).
- Improved support for `XdebugSettings` in launch.json. You can now reliably override any DBGp feature (like `max_data`, `max_children` or `max_depth`). [#2450](https://community.devsense.com/d/2450-xdebug-settings-cannot-be-changed)

### Minor Features

- `@pure` (and `@phpstan-pure`, `@psalm-pure`) tag in code completion. Note, that this feature is not yet used by code analysis.
- Memory use optimizations.
- Code action to simplify string concatenation with string interpolation handles more possible cases.
- Minor syntax differences across PHP `7.x` and `8.x` are respected, i.e. semi-reserved tokens inside namespace names. Syntax inside opened PHP documents is also re-evaluated when [PHP version is changed](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/php-version/#choosing-php-version). Fixes [#963](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/963) and similar.
- PHP 8.5 **URI** extension added to workspace stubs list (not enabled by default - see "Workspace Stubs" command).

### Fixes

- Composer packages with non-standard `installPath` outside the `vendor` directory are not indexed and cached twice; This fixes double occurences in IntelliSense, and unnecessary RAM usage, and unnecessary initial CPU usage. This also improves code flow analysis and overall editor experience in affected projects (like _Drupal_).
- Respects array type annotations for vararg parameters. [#2489](https://community.devsense.com/d/2489)
- Semantic highlight works for class members of an unknown type, i.e. `$unknown->member`.
- In `.blade.php`, the editor was listing code actions for a "code behind" (the code generated by the templating engine); Such code actions were distracting, did not make any sense, and were generating invalid code changes. [#985(2)](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/985)
- Fixes semantic colors in documentary comments, not colorizing when document is being edited, or just saved.
- Improves conditional `@return` annotation using `true` and `false` constants.
- Fixed missing code completion when there is invalid `class_alias()` or `constant()` in the workspace.
- Fixes to NEON files parsing. [#992](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/992)
- Fixes `protected` function visibility check when the method is declared outside the scope but its prototype isn't. [#2496](https://community.devsense.com/d/2496)
- Fixes to `try`/`catch` code flow analysis with `goto`s' label inside `finally`.
- Fixes code completion when an invalid class name or constant name is introduced with bad `define()` or bad `class_alias()` functions.
- Fixes the setting `"php.format.exclude"`, so it works with workspace-relative paths. [2499](https://community.devsense.com/d/2499)
- Fixes `ArrayObject::exchangeArray()` parameters signature. [#2494](https://community.devsense.com/d/2494)
- Implements code completion and mouse hover in union types. [#2492](https://community.devsense.com/d/2492)

## 1.65.18327 (Jan 14, 2026)

### New Features

- PHP 8.5 `clone` as a function with the new syntax and optional argument supported. [#2478](https://community.devsense.com/d/2478)
- PHP 8.0 dereferencable string syntax. [#2479](https://community.devsense.com/d/2479)
- Enabled CodeLens for class property hooks. [#2476](https://community.devsense.com/d/2476)
- New `@return` conditional annotation allowing to compare constants and parameter values (_numbers_, _strings_, and _`null`_), i.e.
  ```php
  /** @return ( $name == null ? false : int ) */
  function foo( $name ) { return $name === null ? false : strlen($name); }
  ```
  or
  ```php
  /** @return ( PHP_MAJOR_VERSION >= 8 ? string[] : array|false ) */
  function foo() { ... }
  ```
  Possible operators are `is` (as before for the type comparison), and newly `==`, `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`.
- `explode()` function shown with PHP version specific return type annotation (in a tooltip, by a type analysis, and in generated documentation). [#860](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/860)
- Added specific colors for interfaces and enums (if supported by users' theme).
- Added colors for type names in type hints of property hooks.

### Fixes

- Fixed CodeLens for enum cases. [#2482](https://community.devsense.com/d/2482)
- Respects generated `_ide_helper`, `_laravel_idea`, and `_laravel_ide` in diagnostics. [#974](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/974), [#2486](https://community.devsense.com/d/2486)
- Fixes falsy warning about wrong member visibility in a `Closure` bound with a new scope.
- Navigation and Mouse Hover works with class properties that are not visible in current scope.
- Fixes syntax errors with `Echo` in a namespace name.
- Fixes type inferring if there is `phpstan/php-8-stubs` composer package which makes all the IntelliSense information ambiguous (slower and less precise). [#2481](https://community.devsense.com/d/2481)
- Possible fix for a rare language server crash. [#979](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/979)

### Unused class members highlighted

Unused class methods, constants, and properties are now dimmed if there are no direct usages.

## 1.64.18270 (Dec 30, 2025)

### Optimizations

We’ve introduced major **parser optimizations** in the editor. The PHP editor now tracks incremental changes and parses code lazily, skipping parsing entirely when edits are insignificant. This cuts CPU usage while typing by roughly 90%, which is especially noticeable in larger PHP files.

In addition, **initial indexing** has been optimized. Still, it is recommended to exclude your workspace folder from antivirus scanning for a better performance.

Lastly, CodeLens support has also been improved. It now uses significantly less CPU, primarily because its underlying algorithm has been reimplemented.

### Fixes

* Fixes completion inside the `.editorconfig` file. Suggestions include possible formatting rules and code-action configurations.
* Improves `is_numeric()` type inference.
* Improves library support in CodeIgniter 3 projects.
* Fixes the diagnostic position for an unexpected `!` in PHPDoc.
* Multiple negative `@phpstan-assert-if-***` annotations with the `empty-string` type hint are now resolved correctly. [#967](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/967)
* Don’t dim or strikethrough code if the corresponding diagnostic has been suppressed.
* Don’t report a wrong class in `catch` clauses when its class hierarchy is not fully known (has unknown base types).
* Fixes a false warning when accessing an array item of a structured array type that has been modified. [#969](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/969)
* Fixes blank-line handling when `Keep*OnOneLine` settings are enabled. [#964](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/964)
* When renaming, an invalid new identifier now results in a popup message with details.
* Correctly finds references to methods from a trait adaptation block, including those renamed by the adaptation block.
* Fixes falsy deprecation of `ReflectionMethod::__construct()`.

### Minor Features

* The `@suppress` (or `@suppresswarnings`) tag recognizes selected `PHPMD` codes.
* The `empty-string` type hint is recognized.
* Diagnostic for an always-false strict comparison. [#971](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/971)
* Deprecation check of legacy constructors is more detailed.

## 1.63.18172 (Dec 3, 2025)

### Minor Features

- Inline PestPHP test case runner support. [@MrPunyapal](https://x.com/MrPunyapal/status/1994339061956329731)
- Code completion for suggested argument string values.
- Supports `@psalm-assert-if-true`, `@psalm-assert-if-false`.
- Supports `@phpstan-assert` or `psalm-assert` with type hint prefixed with `=`, used by PHPUnit's `assertInstanceOf()`.
- Respects `@phpstan-ignore-line`.

### Fixes

- False error when using member field or anonymous function in constant expression. [#955](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/955), [#958](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/958)
- Invalid unnecessary parentheses hint in `and`, `or` conditions. [#2467](https://community.devsense.com/d/2467)
- Language server crash fix when there is invalid `@dataProvider` annotation.

## 1.63.18152 (Nov 27, 2025)

### Minor Features

- Testing runs tests which groups were excluded in `phpunit.xml` configuration but selected/filtered in Testing view. So large/slow tests can be excluded using `<groups><exclude><group>...` XML configuration, so they don't run by default when running all tests. If those excluded tests aree selected or filtered using the filter box, the exclusion is overriden. [#2426](https://community.devsense.com/d/2426-test-explorer-does-not-filter-by-at-group/12)
- Problems in `/vendor/**` folder (including the special subfolders like `composer`) are not listed at all now, unless the file under `vendor` folder is opened in the editor.
- Type narrowing for `is_numeric`. [#2436](https://community.devsense.com/d/2436)
- Added `php-amqp` stubs.
- Settings `files.exclude`, `php.files.exclude`, `search.exclude`, `php.problems.exclude` support glob patterns with groups, ranges, negations, and special characters enclosed in `[`, `]` brackets. [#945](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/945)
- Added command `PHP Tools: Quick Settings ...` to access frequently requested PHP editor settings.
- Updated multi-language PHP manual.
- Dimm unused private class functions. [#800](https://community.devsense.com/d/800)
- Quick refactoring to replace `array_merge` with array spread.
- Quick refactorig to cleanup unnecessary `()` around `new` in PHP >= 8.4.
- Quick refactorig to create new callable syntax from anonymous function.
- Completing variable names inside `compact()` function.
- Diagnostics for constant expressions (`PHP2446`) in attributes and various initializers. Seen in [#2458](https://community.devsense.com/d/2458), [#949](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/949)
- Improves override checks for `enum` definitions with complex hierarchy. [#2460](https://community.devsense.com/d/2460)
- Unknown type checks for union types and intersection types in typed properties. [#2461](https://community.devsense.com/d/2461)

### Fixes

- Fixed auto-closing `)` overtype when completing function with parameters or parentheses. [#947](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/947)
- Fixed quick fixes inside attributes.
- Fixes code action converting to an arrow function containing an object operator `->`.
- Doesn't suggest PSR-4 class name fix, if the file name is not a valid class name identifier.
- Doesn't suggest arrow `fn` in constant expressions. [#949](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/949)
- Unused function declaration not reported for `__construct` and other magic methods.[#950](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/950)
- Fixed `@phpstan-assert` affecting more expressions in the code flow than it should. [#2459](https://community.devsense.com/d/2459)

### Breaking Changes

- The setting `"php.completion.intelliPHP.preSelect"` is `false` by default. Although [this feature is awesome](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/editor/intelliphp/#pre-selecting-the-item-in-the-completion-list), it may slow down code completion by 50 - 250 ms.
